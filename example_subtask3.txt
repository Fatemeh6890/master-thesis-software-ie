Entity:
[Plugin:"DriverNet"] 
[ProgrammingEnvironment: "R"]

Attribute:
[Citation: "[31]"]

Relation:
format in file: "Citation_of	11	9"
11 -> Citation_of -> 9
"[31]" - (Citation_of) -> "R"

[Citation: "[31]"] - (Citation_of) -> [ProgrammingEnvironment: "R"]

# Simple Idea

Input: 
sent = "The DriverNet algorithm is implemented in a publicly available R package [31] ."
[Plugin:"DriverNet"] 
[ProgrammingEnvironment: "R"]
[Citation: "[31]"]

## Ground truth for relations:

            DriverNet       R               [31]
DriverNet   X!              X               X
R           X               X!              (Citation_of-1)
[31]        X               Citation_of     X!

For three annotations (entity+attribute) we have 9 relation candidates.
Three of them are "self relation". six candidates need prediction.
Template:
"sent <SEP> candidate_subject <SEP> candidate_object"

Six Real Model inputs (X):
1. "The DriverNet algorithm is implemented in a publicly available R package [31] .<SEP> DriverNet <SEP> R"
2. "The DriverNet algorithm is implemented in a publicly available R package [31] .<SEP> DriverNet <SEP> [31]"
3. ...
..
6. "The DriverNet algorithm is implemented in a publicly available R package [31] .<SEP> [31] <SEP> R"

Six expected Outputs (y):
1. "nil"
2. "nil"
.
.
6. "Citation_of"






Output simple:


O B-PlugIn_Creation O O O O O O O B-ProgrammingEnvironment_Usage O B-Citation O

# Use Additional Information
 * not each Entity type could have any relation (e.g, Citation -> version_of does not make sense)
 * Define signature as triple (subject_entity_type, relation_type, object_entity_type)
   * Which signatures are allowed and which are not valid?
